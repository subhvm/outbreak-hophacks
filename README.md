Real-time Disease Monitoring and Trend Prediction
About the Project
This project aims to provide real-time data on disease outbreaks across the globe and predict future trends. It helps users monitor case numbers, infection rates, and deaths in different regions, offering a clear picture of the current situation and potential future developments.

Key Features:
Real-time Data: Fetches up-to-date information on diseases from trusted global and local health sources like WHO and CDC.
Interactive Map: Displays outbreak severity on a global scale, using color gradients to represent the intensity of outbreaks across regions.
Prediction Model: A machine learning model predicts future trends based on historical and real-time data.
Data Visualization: The platform uses charts and graphs to represent the progression of cases, infection rates, and deaths over time.
Tech Stack
MERN Stack:

MongoDB: Stores real-time and historical data.
Express.js & Node.js: Backend services to pull and serve data from APIs.
React.js: Frontend for data visualization and interactive map.
APIs: Integrates multiple global and local health APIs for real-time data collection.

Machine Learning: Utilizes a time-series prediction model to forecast future disease trends.

Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Node.js
MongoDB
React.js
Installation:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
